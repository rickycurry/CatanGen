# CatanGen

Generate random Settlers of Catan boards at the (proverbial) click of 
a button. 

Run catan_board.py locally in console by navigating into the directory
and entering "python catan_board.py".

A prompt will ask you to specify number of players -- as of November
29, 2018, only 3-4 players are supported. Type 3 or 4 and hit return.

The board should open in an image viewer, and it is also saved in the
local directory as "temp.png".

At the moment, I use this to generate boards which we then project onto
a whiteboard and play using whiteboard markers. Future goals include
adding 5-6 player functionality and integrating Catan expansions such
as "Cities and Knights" and "Seafarers".
